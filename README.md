# DataDex (Build in progress)
> This is a tentative plan

DataDex is a powerful browser extension designed to assist content creators with research, data aggregation, and content organization. With a range of intuitive features, DataDex aims to streamline the content creation process and enhance productivity.

1. **Smart Screenshots**: Capture and highlight important sections of web pages using the Smart Screenshots feature. Easily annotate and save screenshots as PNG images for reference or inclusion in your content.

2. **Data Extractor**: Extract valuable assets and useful data from web pages with the Data Extractor feature. Organize and present the extracted information in a more convenient and presentable format for content creation.
